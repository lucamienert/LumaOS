# Luma OS

## Description

LumaOS is a x86 32-bit toy operating system, which I am developing to teach myself how computers work.
It is still in an very early development state, so don't try to use it (it will crash everything).
LumaOS is primarily based on [this](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) Tutorial from Carlos Fenollosas.

Features to implement (or already implemented):

- [x] Kernel (interfaced with the GRUB bootloader)
- [x] Global descriptor table (GDT)
- [x] ISRs for CPU interrupt handling
- [x] VGA graphics
- [x] Keyboard drivers
- [x] Filesystem (potentially ext2)
- [ ] Mouse drivers
- [ ] Terminal (Shell)
- [x] Dynamic memory allocation
- [ ] Adding [custom language](https://github.com/lucamienert/lumalang) for further development
- [ ] Finalizing and adding GUI
